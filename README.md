# HokkienLLM

Major TODOs:

1. Add flash cards functionalities
2. Add text to speech
3. Add text to image
4. Figure out how to deploy to a local running server

# Guide to run the app locally

1. Use Conda or any environment manager, and create a new environment
2. `pip install Flask`
3. `python app.py`

And the app should run in localhost
